## üåü Overview

This project investigates the performance of four classifiers:
1. **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**  
2. **Decision Tree**  
3. **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)**  
4. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  

Additionally, it evaluates **kNN** and **SVM** performance on PCA-reduced datasets to analyze the effect of dimensionality reduction.

### Objectives:
1. Implement and evaluate classifiers on original features.
2. Use PCA to reduce dimensionality and re-evaluate kNN and SVM classifiers.
3. Compare performance metrics such as accuracy, Type 1 error, and Type 2 error.

## üìä Dataset Description

Two datasets were used for this analysis:
- **TrainingData.csv**: 900 samples (450 approved, 450 denied applications)
- **TestingData.csv**: 400 samples (200 approved, 200 denied applications)

Each dataset contains **27 features**, with the target label indicating loan approval status:
- `0`: Approved
- `1`: Denied

Key preprocessing steps included:
- Handling missing values (if any).
- Splitting datasets into training and testing sets.
- Standardizing features for kNN and SVM classifiers.

## üõ† Methodology

### **Classifiers**
1. **LDA**: Projects data onto a linear subspace for classification.  
2. **Decision Tree**: Employs CART with Gini impurity for decision-making.  
3. **kNN**: Tested with `k=1, 3, 5, 10`.  
4. **SVM**: Linear kernel with soft margin (C=1).

### **Dimensionality Reduction**
- **PCA**: Feature space reduced to 5, 10, and 15 principal components.
- Re-evaluated kNN (`k=5`) and SVM on PCA-transformed datasets.

### **Metrics**
1. **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of predictions.  
2. **Type 1 Error**: Misclassifying approved applications as denied.  
3. **Type 2 Error**: Misclassifying denied applications as approved.

## üßê Discussion

### **Insights**
1. **SVM with PCA**:  
   - Achieved the best balance of Type 1 and Type 2 errors.
   - Demonstrated PCA‚Äôs effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data.

2. **Impact of PCA**:  
   - Improved SVM performance significantly while reducing computational overhead.
   - Marginal improvement for kNN, indicating its lesser reliance on dimensionality reduction.

3. **Classifier Strengths**:  
   - **LDA**: Best for denied applications (low Type 2 error).  
   - **SVM**: Balanced performance across metrics.  
   - **Decision Tree**: High error rates due to overfitting.  
   - **kNN**: Sensitive to Type 1 errors (misclassifying approvals).
